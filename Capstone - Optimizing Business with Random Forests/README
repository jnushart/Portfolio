This folder contains the code and final writeup of my capstone project for my Master's of Data Science from the University of Wisconsin La Crosse. This project's aim was to show Tractor Supply Company (TSC) what they could improve by using supervised machine learning and Random Forests to their current ship from store program by optimizing their current shipments and future planning.

Original data will not be shared as it will provide too much data regarding TSC's current contracts.
